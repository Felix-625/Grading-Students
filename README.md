# Grading-Students

This program reads a list of student grades, and for each grade, it checks if it's below 38 (in which case it is not rounded), otherwise it calculates the next multiple of 5 and rounds the grade up to it only if the difference is less than 3, then returns and prints the updated list of grades after applying the rounding rules.
